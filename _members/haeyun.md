I am now an assistant professor at KOREATECH from March 2024. Before joining KOEATECH, I was a staff engineer at SAMSUNG SDI. I received my master's and doctorate degree in Information and Communication Engineering from DGIST where I was thankfully advised by Prof. Jae Youn Hwang in 2018 and 2022 and a bachelor's degree in Mathematics from Chonbuk National University in 2016.  From January 2020 to August 2021, I worked as a visiting Ph.D. student at Medical Bigdata Research Center, Seoul National University Colledge of Medicine.
