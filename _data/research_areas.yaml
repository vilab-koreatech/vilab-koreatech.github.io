- title: Medial Image Analysis
  description: >
    We develop artificial intelligence–based methods for medical image analysis to support accurate diagnosis and clinical decision-making. Our research focuses on robust learning frameworks that handle variability across patients, devices, and institutions. 
    By leveraging attention mechanisms, self-supervised learning, and adaptive inference strategies, we aim to enable reliable deployment of AI systems in real-world clinical environments.

- title: Image Synthesis
  description: >
    We explore image synthesis techniques tailored for medical imaging to address data scarcity and domain gaps between synthetic and real clinical data. Our work emphasizes realistic degradation modeling and restoration to generate medically meaningful images. 
    These approaches facilitate effective training, benchmarking, and evaluation of medical imaging algorithms under practical clinical conditions.
